					<h3>Loans that help</h3>
					<p>A small loan is a great solution if you need to renovate your home, buy new furniture for the terrace, repair your car or to finance your next big thing.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Borrow from 500 up to 20 000 â‚¬ without collateral.</li>
						<li>Money is transferred to the account immediately after the conclusion of the contract.</li>
						<li>It is possible to make early repayments without any additional fees.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><i class="fa fa-lg fa-clock-o"></i> It takes only 1-2 minutes to fill loan application.</p>
					<p>
						Please note, that by using financial services you assume financial obligations. Improper execution of financial obligations may adversely affect your
						credit history and raise the cost of borrowing, and it can also cause initiation of enforced recovery.
